<!-- The code defines an object called "holidays" containing the dates and names of various holidays. It uses the "Date" object to get the current year to set the date for each holiday. There is a variable called "trueID" which is not defined because it tries to access a property of the holidays object that does not exist. Three console logs follow, which compare the current Christmas date to a new date, and then check for changes in the ID, name, and date of the copied object. The code then finds the first and last holiday of the year, and logs them in a new format. Finally, a function is defined to format a date as dd/mm/yyyy and logs the formatted version of the first, last, and a randomly selected holiday. -->
